Project Goals:

- Provide a function that enables a user to add a picture of the day. That is, one picture connected to the days date.
- Provide a user interface accessible from several devices. Computer, iOS, Android. The user interface in this regard is an administrative end of the UI. I.e. adding new pictures.
- Provide a presentation view of the data. For instance as a calendar with any photo associated to it - a thumbnail will be included.

Technical:
- What techniques are to be used? Groovy and Grails? GWT and Vaadin are other interesting options.
- How should the server interface be designed? A RESTful interface comes to mind. However that might break the niceties with for instance Groovy+Grails.
- How to ensure a UI usable by mobile devices as well as desktop machines?
- How should the data model be designed?

Project management:
- Project planning tool? JIRA? What support exists from github?
- Traditional SCRUM or just waterfall (since developer commitment will be an issue and sprints of 3-4 weeks are improbable)
- Issue tracking?
- Bug tracking?
